# Single Sign-On (SSO)

Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID and password to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.

---

## SSO Progress:

If a user visits an `consumer` or `user module`-protected service (`foo.sso.example.com`) and does not have a session cookie, they are redirected to `sso-auth` (`sso-auth.example.com`).
   - If the user **does not** have a session cookie for `sso-auth`,
     they are prompted to log in via the `sso-auth`, and then
     redirected back to `consumer` or `user module` (according to their user role) where they will now be logged in (to
     `foo.sso.example.com`)
   - If the user *does* have a session cookie for `sso-auth` (e.g. they
     have already logged into `bar.sso.example.com`), they are
     transparently redirected back to `consumer` where they will be logged in,
     without needing to go through the `sso-auth`
